Querying Open Alex for rates of open access for publications authored by researchers affiliated with NZ universities. 

## Background

The Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) released an [Open Research Policy](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/agencies-policies-and-budget-initiatives/open-research-policy/) in November 2022 which:

> ...requires that all peer-reviewed publications arising from research funded through research investment processes administered by MBIE be made available with Open Access (free of charge, online access for any person) through one of the approved pathways.

Universities NZ released a [Pan-University Statement on Open Access](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/sites/default/files/uni-nz/documents/Open%20Access%20Statement.pdf) which includes a goal to:

> Increase open access across our university repositories from 48% of published research (current)
to 70% by 2025.

This dashboard is an attempt to monitor rates of open access across New Zealand universities.
